### Authors: Group I Paloma Cartwright, Julia Parish, Quinlan Smith

## Assignment 2: Almond Yield Function
This model was developed as an assignment for a UCSB Bren School Masterâ€™s program course, Environmental Data Science 230: | Environmental Science Management 232: Environmental Modeling. 

Original assignment instructions can be found [here](https://naomitague.github.io/ESM232_course/assignments/almond_yield_function.html). 

### Motivation and Goal
This environmental model and analysis was completed as an assignment for the course, Environmental Data Science 230 | Environmental Science & Management: Modeling Environmental Systems. The source data and model design is based on research published in the paper, [Impacts of future climate change on California perennial crop yields: Model projections with climate and crop uncertainties by Lobell et al. (2006)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016819230600308X). This assignment focuses on developing the skills to creation functions in R, source R scripts into RMarkdown files, and learn how to build a simple model to analyze environmental data.

The **goal** of this assignment was to build a model of almond yield production in California between the years 1989 and 2010 based on precipitation and temperature data. 

### Installation
The following **packages** were utilized:
- `here`
- `lubridate`
- `tidyverse`

### Data

Model parameter values were taken from [Lobell et al. (2006)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016819230600308X). Climate data were source from [here](https://github.com/naomitague/ESM232_Examples/tree/main/Data). 

## Assignment 3: Almond Profit Sensitivity Analysis 

Original assignment instructions can be found [here](https://naomitague.github.io/ESM232_course/assignments/assign3_informal_sen.html). 

### Motivation and Goal

For assignment 3, we built upon the previous assignment's almond yield production model. 

The **goal** of this assignment was to
